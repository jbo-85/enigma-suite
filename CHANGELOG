Version 0.76
8 July 2006

  eclient-rpc.py:
                New XML-RPC client. The client is an alternative for
                the existing client.

  enigma-client.py:
                Improved file locking with flock(). Sets default timeout
                for sockets.

  install.py:   New install script guides through the installation process.

  add-cpus/:
                scripts for multiple CPUs/cores are now included.


Version 0.75
28 March 2006

  hillclimb.c, cipher.c:
                From now on only unique scrambler states are tested.
                The -a, -x options (and the default) have a different
                meaning now. mr_mode is supplanted by sw_mode.

  enigma.c, key.c:
                Simulator: Defaults for M4 UKW changed to B-THIN/Beta.

  enigma-client.py:
                All log output goes to stderr. Added -r switch that
                causes enigma to write output to the file "results".
                Added ability to download new dictionaries automatically.

                Suggestions came from (alphabetical order, sorry if I
                forget anyone):

                Ian Flanigan, Steve Hosgood, A.S., Geoff Sullivan.  


Version 0.73.2
27 February 2006

  conf-cc:      -O3 generally leads to better performance.
                Reported by Jeff Gilchrist.


Version 0.73.1
10 February 2006

  enigma.1, enigma.txt:
                Fixed bug in explanation of 00hc.resume format.


Version 0.73
18 January 2006

  enigma-client.py:
                Switched to popen2.Popen3() instead of os.system().
                Added signal handling of SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGQUIT:

                  - Now Ctrl-C stops enigma-client on OpenBSD (always
                    did on Linux).

                  - enigma-client removes the lock file on signalled
                    exit.

                  - Both processes exit cleanly when either enigna-client
                    or enigma is signalled.

                Added status messages.

  enigma.c:     Removed bug so that -o and -R options can actually be used
                together.

  hillclimb.c:  Status messages are displayed when enigma runs in resume mode.



Version 0.72
7 January 2006

  hillclimb.c:  Removed calls of free() and fprintf() from signal handler.
                New version has longer shutdown time on SIGTERM. Worst case
                is around 0.1 s on a Pentium 400MHz with a ciphertext length
                of 250 letters.

  ic.c:         Replaced instances of 250 with CT.

  enigma-client.py:
                Changed class name to Eclient.
                Switched to 00trigr.naval/00bigr.naval

  eclient-install.sh:
                Switched to 00trigr.naval/00bigr.naval

  dict/ :       Added new naval statistics compiled from original
                M4 messages.
