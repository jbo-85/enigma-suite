=============================
General install instructions
=============================


Installation is as straightforward as it can get:


Edit conf-cc and conf-ld to fit your compiler.

Compile:
========

   make

Try gmake if you get errors.


Install:
========
I have not included an install target in the Makefile; there is a name conflict
with a game that is also called enigma (e.g. in Debian), so think about where
to install.

Example:

   cp enigma /usr/local/bin &&
   cp tools/mkdict.py /usr/local/bin &&
   cp tools/SGT /usr/local/bin &&
   cp doc/enigma.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1 &&
   cp doc/mkdict.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1


======================
Install enigma-client
======================

Dependencies: Python (tested with version 2.3 or higher)

Choose a directory for enigma-client to run in (default: ~/.enigma-client).
Change into the enigma-client directory and edit the eclient-install.sh
script if you want to change the default.

   ./eclient-install.sh


==================
Run enigma-client
==================

IF YOU HAVE A DIAL-UP INTERNET CONNECTION, MAKE SURE THAT DIAL-ON-DEMAND
IS DISABLED.

Enough screaming. As probably any distributed-computing client, enigma-client
will try to connect to the server. If you have DIAL-ON-DEMAND enabled,
every connection attempt will result in a phone call.

By contrast, if DIAL-ON-DEMAND is disabled, attempts to make a connection will
silently fail, unless you have dialed in to you ISP anyway.

I think it is a good idea to disable DIAL-ON-DEMAND in general.
Be warned!


Start enigma-client manually:
=============================

Whenever you want to start ./enigma-client, just execute:

   ~/.enigma-client/ecrun


Start enigma-client automatically on bootup:
============================================


SysVinit runlevel concept:
--------------------------
The easiest thing would be to create an entry in /etc/inittab. First
look in the /etc/rc* or /etc/init.d/rc* directories to find out in
which runlevels the usual network services (mailer daemon, ...) are up.

As far as I can see, for SuSE that would be (3,4,5), for Debian or Ubuntu
it would be (2,3,4,5). I am not using any of those, so check for yourself.

Create an entry at the end of /etc/inittab, the second field containing
the runlevels where enigma-client should be running:

EC:345:respawn:/bin/su - <user> -c /home/<user>/.enigma-client/ecboot


Tell init about the change in inittab:

telinit Q


BSD style init:
---------------

You'll know how to do it. ;)
